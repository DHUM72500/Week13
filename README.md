# Week13
In Week 13, we're adding a very simple form of computational text analysis. You'll find Word Cloud generators all over the web and in many different kinds of graphical interface text anaysis tools. In this example, you see a little bit of the code that one might use to create a word cloud using Python. These are simplistic, but also designed for you to take, change, manipulate, improve upon, and grow. 

When we consider what a "feminist text analysis" looks like, could we start with someting as simple as a word cloud? In the typical word cloud, what we measure is frequency. Words with the greatest frequency display most prominently. Words with the lowest frequency are less visible. If, for example, we're visualizing all the lines of a Disney play (see Week 9 readings), and we know that most of the lines are spoken by male characters, what does measuring word repetition do to our understanding of the movie? When characters who are non-male identifying occupy a greater proportion of the language, is frequency the best measure of what is said? 

How might a word cloud be made to *challenge* rather than reinforce the assumption that repetition of a lie is more valuable (deserves greater prominance) than something true told once?

You could complete this notebook by simply running it, or you take it and make changes. You might consider looking at weeks in which we practiced importing and manipulating text data. You could simply cut and copy new text. You could explore the many different adjustments you can make to the WordCloud function by reading the ?Wordcloud output.
